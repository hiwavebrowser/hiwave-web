# HiWave

**A browser that gets out of your way.**

---

## The Problem

Your browser is cluttered. Hundreds of tabs you'll never revisit. Bookmarks you forgot exist. Ads everywhere. Trackers following you across the web.

## The Solution

HiWave is a privacy-first browser built on one principle: **less is more.**

- **Tabs decay naturally** — Unused tabs fade to The Shelf, keeping your workspace clean without losing anything
- **Workspaces replace bookmarks** — Organize by context (Work, Personal, Research), not folders you'll never open
- **Ads blocked by default** — 800,000+ domains blocked out of the box. No extensions needed.
- **Your data stays yours** — No telemetry. No tracking. No account required.
